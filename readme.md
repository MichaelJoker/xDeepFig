Our group aims at implementing feature generation CNN (FGCNN) and xDeepFM for Click-through rate (CTR) prediction. In addition, we proposed our own idea by combining these two models together and achieved a better performance.

**ctr_predict.py**: The main python file for our project
**FGCNN_xDeepFM.py**: Our Proposed idea by combining these two models together
Also, there are three folders called **core**, **datasets** and **models**. **core** folder contains some necessary modules for implementing FGCNN, xDeepFM and our combined model. **datasets** folder contains our data set and **data_sample_processing.ipynb** for processing the raw data set as it is large and we cannot process it even in our server. So we need to sample it. **models** folder contains two baseline models, DCN and DeepFM, and it also contains FGCNN and xDeepFM models.
